								<p>Implementing tags was a critical step in measuring the performance of a pharmaceutical brand's website, and it was important to ensure that the tags were implemented in compliance with HIPAA regulations. To accomplish this, the process of form collection was thoroughly reviewed to ensure that all fields were properly secured and that personal information was not being collected unnecessarily. Additionally, it was important to implement tags that were specific to the collection and tracking of personal health information (PHI) and implement additional security measures such as SSL encryption.</p>
								<p>Once the tags were implemented, it was important to regularly check the status of the tags to ensure that they were functioning properly and that data was being collected as expected. This was done by conducting regular QA testing on the website and reviewing the data in the analytics platform to ensure that it matched the expected results. Additionally, it was important to have a process in place for identifying and troubleshooting any issues that may have arisen with the tags.</p>
								<p>To share the performance of the website with shareholders and stakeholders, regular reporting on KPIs and business sprints was important. This included metrics such as website traffic, form submissions, and conversions. Additionally, it was important to provide insights into how the website was performing for specific brands such as HUMIRA, RINVOQ, and SKYRIZI. This was done by creating customized dashboards that provided a detailed view of the website's performance for each brand, and by providing regular updates to shareholders and stakeholders on the progress of the website and its impact on the business.</p>
